# Empowering In-Network Classification in Programmable Switches by Binary Decision Tree and Knowledge Distillation
**More information about us** [https://xgr19.github.io](https://xgr19.github.io)  

This is Mousikav2 published in ToN 2023. We provides the whole distillation codes (5 teachers of RF, GBDT, GRU, LSTM, and MLP) in this branch.

We hope that our another In-network intelligence work [Soter](https://github.com/xgr19/Soter) would be also helpful for you.
